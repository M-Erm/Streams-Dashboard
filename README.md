## Features

> The actual version is not complete and misses some features, like Twitch Streams.

### Live right now
- **Active streams panel** — Shows all VTubers currently live on YouTube with thumbnails, titles, and viewer counts
- **Upcoming streams panel** — Scheduled streams with start times, sorted chronologically
- **Custom new tab page** — Takes over Firefox's new tab with a full-screen dashboard
- **Wallpaper support** *(planned)* — Set and save custom backgrounds via the extension popup

### Architecture highlights
- Backend runs on **Cloudflare Workers** (Hono + TypeScript) — zero cold-start latency on the free plan
- Chunked parallel fetching to stay within Cloudflare's connection limits per request
- In-memory caching with timestamp-based expiration to minimize YouTube API quota usage
- API key never exposed to the client — all YouTube Data API calls go through the Worker

## Roadmap

- [ ] Twitch live stream support
- [ ] Horizontal → vertical layout toggle
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Extension popup with:
  - [ ] Wallpaper picker (upload and persist)
  - [ ] Per-VTuber channel filtering (show/hide)
  - [ ] Starred channels pinned to the top of the dashboard
  - [ ] Optional live preview on thumbnail hover (iframe)
- [ ] Paginated/scrollable upcoming streams (currently capped at 5 visible)
